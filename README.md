# GitHub Issues and Project issues importer

### Description

This script creates new GitHub issues in repositories from a CSV file
and optionally, to add these issues to Projects.

The script reads issues, one per row, from a CSV file and creates corresponding GitHub issues.

The goal is to make it easier to manage and track many issues and tasks using GitHub's project
management system.

### Features

- Bulk import from CSV to GitHub as issues.
- Optionally add these issues to a Project.
- Labels are also imported. Use a list sperated by coma 
- Issues can have a single parent issue. They will be also added to the parent as GitHub sub-issues.
- Support for custom fields in the CSV, thta are added to the Project items as custom fields:
  - Estimate is imported from the "project_estimate" column with a rough estimate to complete in
    number of days
  - IssueID is imported from the "project_issue_id" column and is used to track these external ids
    we assign to an issue.
  - ParentIssueID is imported from the "project_parent_issue_id" column and is used to track
    external ids we assign to an issue. Use to create subissues.
  
Not supported: Nothing not listed above including
- Priority, iterations, size and status.
- Assignees.

### Getting started

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A GitHub personal access token with `repo` permissions exported as a GITHUB_TOKEN variable
- A CSV file containing task information to upload.

This script read a CSV and creates GitHub issues, and add these to GitHub projects.
You need first to install these dependencies in your virtualenv::

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run the script this way::

    python src/import_issue.py --help

You need to have pre-existing repositories and projects created in GitHub.

### Convert milestone + task CSVs

If you have separate milestone and task CSV files, convert them first to the
single `issues.csv` format expected by this importer:

```bash
python src/convert_milestones_tasks.py \
  --milestones-file /path/to/milestones.csv \
  --tasks-file /path/to/tasks.csv \
  --output-file /path/to/issues-ready.csv \
  --account-type organization \
  --account-name YOUR_GITHUB_ORG \
  --repo-name YOUR_GITHUB_REPO \
  --project-number 0
```

Notes:
- Milestones are converted to parent issues.
- Tasks are converted to sub-issues linked using `project_issue_id` and
  `project_parent_issue_id`.
- `--project-number 0` means issues are created only in the repo (not added to
  GitHub Projects).
- Set `--project-number` to your project number if you want project items too.
- Add `--no-milestone-issues` if you want to create only task issues while still
  assigning GitHub milestones to tasks.


#### CSV File Format

See the issues.csv for an example.

The CSV has these columns:

Core fields:
- account_type: required for projects, GitHub account type: either a "user" or an "organization"
- account_name: required, GitHub account name that owns the repo_name where to create the issues
  (and who owns the optional "project_number" to append issues to.)
- repo_name: required, GitHub repo name where to create the issues

- title: required, GitHub issue title.
- body: required, GitHub issue body.


##### Optional Project support:

- project_number: optional for projects, GitHub project number in the "account_name". The issue
  will be added to this project.

Optional Project fields support:

- project_estimate: a rough estimate to complete this issue as a number of days.
  This is used to populate an "Estimate" custom project field that needs to be created first as
  a "number" field in the Project.

Optional repo milestone support:

- milestone: optional GitHub milestone title to set on an issue. If the milestone does not
  exist yet in the target repository, it is auto-created during import.

##### Optional issue ids and subissues support:

We can related issues to parent issues using "subissues". We use two columns for issues id and subissues:

- "project_issue_id": arbitrary issue id string. Must be unique across all rows in a project import.
  Used to populate the IssueID project field.

- "project_parent_issue_id": arbitrary parent issue id string used to uniquely identify a parent issue.
  Must exist also as a project_issue_id. An issue can only have a sinple unique parent.
  Used to populate the ParentIssueID project field.
